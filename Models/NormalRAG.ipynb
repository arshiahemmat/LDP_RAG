Case Study: Revamping a Citizen Feedback System\\n\\nA municipal government's citizen feedback system was largely unused, with low submission rates and slow response times. An internal analysis revealed that the system's complexity and lack of transparency regarding feedback processing were major deterrents for citizens, leading to a critical internal service delivery failure. They launched a simplified mobile app that allowed real-time issue reporting with photo uploads and provided status updates.
